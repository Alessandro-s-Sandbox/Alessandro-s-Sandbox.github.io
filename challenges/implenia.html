    Implenia Challenge: How can we save lives in construction?
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        Health and Safety is a paramount issue for us, as it is for any other construction firm. Preventing the most
        common accidents is not only a moral imperative, it can also have a direct impact on our ability to function as
        a leading construction and real estate company. Making sure that everyone gets home safely from the
        construction sites every day is crucial.
    </p>
    <ul class="indented">  
        <li>How would you create a solution to help us achieve this?</li>
        <li>How we can save lives on a construction site?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Currently, the types and causes of accidents we encounter on construction sites are:
        <ul class="indented">  
            <li>Tripping/Falling</li>
            <li>PPE not used (personal protective equipment)</li>
            <li>Handing over supervision responsibility insufficiently after a shift</li>
            <li>Taking shortcuts when walking/not defining correct routes</li>
            <li>Placing tripping hazards on the site</li>
            <li>Not ensuring all steps are performed in their correct sequence/checklist</li>
            <li>Inadequate securing when working at height</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        We are looking for:
        <ul class="indented">
            <li>AI/Robotic based solution</li>
            <li>Must function on site or be accessible on site</li>
            <li>Must be useable with minimal instruction</li>
            <li>Must be scalable</li>
        </ul>
