    **Bristol Myers Squibb understands that patients with HCM face a numer of pain points along their treatment journey, and we are dedicated to doing everything we can to ease these burdens.**  
    Our challenge to the participants in the 2023 LauzHack Hackathon is to propose innovative solutions to these pain points, which can include delays in diagnosis, difficulties in navigating healthcare system, finding adequate patient support and adequately monitoring disease symptoms. We hope the teams engaged in our challenge will leverage a quick education about HCM and the patient experience to find innovative solutions that could include digital components such as generative AI and digital health systems and products to offer improved patient monitoring, support, and personalized care.

    **Unmasking Issues in the Feedback Maze.**  
    Every day, millions of customers purchase from e-commerce websites across the globe and thousands write feedback about their likes and dislikes on the purchased products and services. It is impossible for humans to manually review all the feedback and take action to improve the customer experience. In this hackathon, users are given with a dataset to identify key issues that feedbacks contain and group them using their similarity.

    **Promote the emergence of sustainability projects (ideas and projects) on the EPFL campus, debated and supported by its community.**  
    To do this, we create an application that is divided into 2 phases:
    * Survey tools on questions asked by administration (VPT/management). The type of voting could be inspired by Smartvote (https://www.smartvote.ch/fr/home?locale=fr_CH). When voting, we add the time we have available for this project, for cases where there is a need to provide help (promote the action of these projects). A draw of participants who voted yes with time to complete it (time-related crowdfunding).
    * List the projects to which I answered yes with time available to devote to them.
    This application will be used, for example, to explore ideas from the climate strategy and get the EPFL community thinking. Question to propose for instance: Would you like to switch to 100% red meat-free dishes?
    For EPFL, this would improve the feasibility of projects. This is community assistance to support actions to reduce polling. These polls will be discussed in this application.
    In terms of timing, this survey will be carried out 1 to 2 times per year.
    The code must be open source, and modifiable for other uses (questions asked by the entire EPFL community, with or without anonymization-moderation, add questions/forum by the community, encourage meetings of participants who have answered around lunch depending on availability and chance).
    AIs like ChatGPT are very good at summarizing concepts. They can be used in this application to summarize the arguments debated (automated debate report.)

    **Chat with your system!**
    Idea:
    Chatbot based on machine (or any applications) logs model. Could think of a layered approach with LLM frontend that can enrich its knowledge by querying logs (or any dataset available).
    Can answer questions like: "How many reboots in the past 30 days?", "How is network connection behaving?", "Was there any error in the last 24h?", etc...
    Let your imagination speak!

    Switzerland's diverse landscape calls for a mobility solution that is as flexible and varied as the needs of its people. Our vision is clear: create a sustainable and interconnected transportation system that serves everyone, from city dwellers to countryside residents. This challenge invites you to develop a comprehensive travel planner that integrates personal vehicle use with SBB's Park and Rail options and public transport networks. Your solution should offer efficient, user-friendly routing choices that cater to different preferences, whether for example it's reducing the number of transfers, optimizing for speed, or minimizing environmental impact or other criteria. The aim is to provide a practical, adaptable tool that enhances mobility for all, making it easier for individuals to navigate the unique Swiss geography in an eco-conscious manner. Your innovation could not only improve daily commutes but also contribute to a broader vision of sustainable and accessible transportation in Switzerland.
