    Health and Safety is a paramount issue for us, as it is for any other construction firm.
    Preventing the most common accidents is not only a moral imperative, it can also have a direct impact on our ability to function as a leading construction and real estate company.
    Making sure that everyone gets home safely from the construction sites every day is crucial.
    How would you create a solution to help us achieve this?
    How can we **save lives on a construction site**?

    Build a **train door button detector**!
    Today, blind people can be guided to the right track at the right time by the [SBB Inclusive](https://news.sbb.ch/fr/article/98842/inclusive-cff-remporte-le-prix-de-la-canne-blanche) app.
    But they have no tools to find the door. This leads to inconveniences for visually impaired customers.
    They sometimes have to scan the train with their hands to find the door buttons, and we all know that – despite our efforts – trains are not always squeaky clean on the outside.
    If we can guide the blind to the door buttons, we make their public transport experience much better and safer, which is what we would like to do.
